# ToDoApp
A fully made To-Do List application (with a fully functioning express server).

Used JS, EJS, CSS, HTML, and node.js to create a web application for users to add tasks to complete and upon completion
be allowed to strike through the completed task. 

Before running, npm modules must be installed (check dependencies in package.json).
